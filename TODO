# Doubts
- I dont know if it is supose to appear message in textbox?

- Does the server must also send message to client?

- Do we have 2 threds in Client?


# TODO
- Implement priv messages **DONE**

- Pretify the messages 

- Implement clients states **DONE**

- Buffer (allow /ni<CTR-D>ck <CTR-D>na<CTR-D>me) experiment in terminal `nc localhost 8000` and type the the comands **DONE**

- disconnect appears twice when BYE, i think its a client problem

# LATER

- add a class that encapsulates all info, istead of 4 map structures? NOW 5 maps!
my idea would be to create a class ClientContext that has state, nickname and room and outside a map with a key SocketChanel and value ClientContext
