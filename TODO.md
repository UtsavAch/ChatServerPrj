# Doubts
- Is it is supose to appear message in textbox?

- Does the server must also send message to client?

- Do we have 2 threds in Client?


# TODO
- **DONE** Implement priv messages 

- Pretify the messages 

- **DONE** Implement clients states 

- **DONE** Buffer (allow /ni<CTR-D>ck <CTR-D>na<CTR-D>me) experiment in terminal `nc localhost 8000` and type the the comands 

- **DONE** disconnect appears twice when BYE, i think its a client problem 

- **DONE** deal with `/notacommand` it should print ERROR if not in chat, if in chat it should send to the server `//notacommand` and the server sees it has 2 `/` and sends it as a `MESSAGE user /notacommand`

# LATER IF WE HAVE TIME!

- add a class that encapsulates all info, istead of 4 map structures? NOW 5 maps!
my idea would be to create a class ClientContext that has state, nickname and room and outside a map with a key SocketChanel and value ClientContext
